We provided a set of C++ code in the "Code" folder that scans the space of all 8-round differential trail cores of Subterranean up to weight 115.
To do so, we start by scanning the space of all 4-round differential trail cores up to weight 57.


In addition, the list of all 3-round differential trail cores up to weight 40 is available in the "3-roundTrailCores" folder.
